            <h1>Hobby</h1>
            <p>Most of my free time is devoted to drawing and reading manga, though I often find myself immersed in video games. While gaming might not seem productive at first, it allows me to experience different worlds, art styles, and storytelling approaches. These experiences continually fuel my creativity and inspire new ideas whether in character design, visual storytelling, or worldbuilding.
            Every game, story, and artwork I encounter becomes part of my creative journey, shaping how I see and express the vast world of “stories.”</p>
